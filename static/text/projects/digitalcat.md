My personal website

When I thought about how I should meet the need of an online presence for myself, I considered free alternatives, but instead I chose to take the road less travelled: making my own.

Despite being more time consuming and the current version still being very much a work in progress, making my own website gave me the opportunity to learn more Python in the area of web development. This website runs on a Python on Flask back end, serving an HTML5 front end, using Bootstrap as a CSS framework.

It is still limited and still has room for improvement for what I already have included.

Some more features to come include:

* CSS media queries to enable better readability on smaller screens.

* Replacing of the default green boxes with specific images for specific projects

The source code for the website can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/purrcat259/digitalcat).
