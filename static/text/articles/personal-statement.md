A personal statement regarding my work ethic

# Never perfect, always improving.

### Never perfect

Humans are not perfect and since software is written by humans, it inherits this unwanted trait. Reminding myself that any work I do, be it software, academic, art, creative or technical, will never be perfect helps take the pressure off for it to be perfect.

### Always improving

My works never being perfect cannot become an excuse to slack off or to do soppy work. Reminding myself that my work is iterative means that there is always more work to do to make it faster, more stable or more polished.
